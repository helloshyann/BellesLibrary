                                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
                                    bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
                                    the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                                    conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
                                    “without pictures or conversations?”
                                </p>

                                    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
                                    hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
                                    making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
                                    picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
                                    close by her.
                                </p>

                                    Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

                                    When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be
                                    celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence,
                                    there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the
                                    Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected
                                    return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a
                                    local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say,
                                    that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that
                                    was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at.
                                    Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he
                                    was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark.
                                    There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it
                                    seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as
                                    well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
                                </p>

                                    ‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will
                                    come of it!’

                                    All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this.
                                    One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother.
                                    I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried,
                                    “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew
                                    that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

                                    and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded
                                    frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike
                                    shadows that raced along the ground.
